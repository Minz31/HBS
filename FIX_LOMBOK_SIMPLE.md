# Fix Lombok Errors - Simple Instructions

## The Problem
Your IDE shows "cannot find symbol" errors for methods like:
- `hotel.getOwner()`
- `hotel.setStatus()`
- `user.getFirstName()`
- etc.

These methods DO exist - they're generated by Lombok at compile time.

## The Solution

### Step 1: Reload Your IDE
**VS Code:**
- Press `Ctrl+Shift+P`
- Type "Java: Clean Java Language Server Workspace"
- Click it and restart VS Code

**IntelliJ IDEA:**
- File → Invalidate Caches → Invalidate and Restart

### Step 2: If Step 1 Doesn't Work
Open terminal in `springboot_backend_jwt` folder and run:

```bash
# If you have Maven installed:
mvn clean install -DskipTests

# OR if Maven wrapper exists:
mvnw.cmd clean install -DskipTests

# OR from parent folder:
cd ..
cd springboot_backend_jwt
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

### Step 3: Verify Lombok Plugin
**VS Code:**
- Install extension: "Lombok Annotations Support for VS Code"

**IntelliJ:**
- File → Settings → Plugins → Search "Lombok" → Install

## Why This Happens
- Lombok uses `@Getter` and `@Setter` annotations
- These generate methods at compile time
- Your IDE needs to process these annotations first
- Once compiled, all errors will disappear

## Quick Test
If the application runs successfully with `mvn spring-boot:run`, then Lombok is working correctly - it's just an IDE display issue.

## All Entities Are Correct
Your entities already have proper Lombok annotations:
- Hotel.java has `@Getter @Setter`
- User.java has `@Getter @Setter`  
- Room.java has `@Getter @Setter`
- No code changes needed!
